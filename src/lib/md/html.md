# HTML (HyperText Markup Language)

---

[`HTML (HyperText Markup Language)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as CSS and JavaScript. HTML elements are the building blocks of web pages, and HTML provides the structure of a web page, while CSS and JavaScript provide the presentation and behavior, respectively.

HTML elements are represented by tags, and these tags label pieces of content such as "heading," "paragraph," "table," and so on.

The language is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) and the Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG).

HTML is:

- **Structured**: Provides the structural foundation for web pages with elements and tags.
- **Hypertext**: Supports hyperlinks, enabling navigation between documents and resources.
- **Universal**: Understood by all web browsers, making it the universal language of the web.
