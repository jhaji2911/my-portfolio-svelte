# Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)

---

[`Sass (Syntactically Awesome Stylesheets)`](https://sass-lang.com/) is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. SassScript is the scripting language itself. Sass extends CSS by introducing features such as variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, which help keep stylesheets DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to maintain.

Sass can be written in two syntaxes: the indented syntax (Sass) and the SCSS syntax, which is a superset of CSS3.

The language is open-source and available under the MIT License, with its source code hosted on GitHub.

Sass is:

- **Extensible**: Adds features like variables, nested rules, and mixins to standard CSS.
- **Maintainable**: Helps keep stylesheets DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) and easier to manage.
- **Compatible**: SCSS syntax is a superset of CSS, allowing for seamless integration with existing CSS code.

## Example

```scss
$primary-color: lightblue;

body {
    background-color: $primary-color;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
    margin-left: 20px;
}
```
