# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

---

[`CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS defines how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, or in other media. It is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

CSS enables the separation of content from presentation, improving content accessibility, and providing more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics.

The language is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).

CSS is:

- **Declarative**: Use CSS rules to describe how elements should be styled.
- **Separable**: Allows separation of content from presentation, making it easier to maintain and update.
- **Responsive**: Enables the creation of responsive web designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices.

## Example

```css
body {
    background-color: lightblue;
}

h1 {
    color: navy;
    margin-left: 20px;
}
```
