# TypeScript (TS)

---

[`TypeScript (TS)`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) is a free and open-source programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft. It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript, adding static typing to the language. TypeScript is designed for the development of large applications and transcompiles to JavaScript, allowing TypeScript code to run anywhere JavaScript runs.

TypeScript enhances JavaScript by adding optional static types, classes, and interfaces, providing early error detection and robust code refactoring capabilities.

The language is open-source and available under the Apache License 2.0, with its source code hosted on GitHub.

TypeScript is:

- **Typed**: Provides optional static typing, enhancing code quality and reducing runtime errors.
- **Scalable**: Suitable for large codebases and complex applications.
- **Compatible**: Transpiles to JavaScript, making it compatible with existing JavaScript code and frameworks.

## Example

```ts
function greet(name: string): string {
    return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}

console.log(greet('World')); // Output: Hello, World!
```
